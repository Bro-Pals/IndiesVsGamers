'Scene' and 'Screen' are the same things

----------------------World files:------------------------

	Header tags:

	ROW <int row>
		-how many rows wide the world will be

	COL <int col>
		- how many columns high the world will be

	PLAYER_SPAWN <int sceneRow> <int sceneCol> <int x> <int y>
		- the scene and the location on the scene the player spawns

	
--------------Actual world tags for the world file:---------------------
	
	SCENE <int row> <int col>
		-indicate that you're starting to define a scene. When there is already a scene being
			defined and you put down another SCENE tag, then the laste scene will be 
			done being defined

	[HAZARD | BLOCK] <int x> <int y> <int width> <int height> 
			[<I> <String ImageKey> | 
			 <A> <String ImageKey> <int spriteWidth> <int spriteHeight> intdelay>]
		-Creates a new TexturedBlock in the world with an image. The first two parameters give the scene the
			block will show up in. The next two is the x and y position and the width and height
			 of the block when one is on the screen. Finally, either an Image or an animation is defined.
		-Depending on the first thing said, it will be either a hazard that kills you or a block.

	BACKGROUND <String imageKey>
		- Specify what background to draw for that scene. 

-------------Actual quest file tags for QUEST files-------------------

	GOAL <int sceneRow> <int sceneCol>
		-define what screen the goal is going to be located in. This is so
			the arrow guiding the player points to the right scene

	[SPAWN_GOAL | SPAWN] <String enemyType> <sceneRow> <sceneCol> <x> <y>
		-spawn an enemy at the given scene location and at the given position.
		-The spawn is either a normal spawn or a special spawn defining the
			enemy to kill to complete the quest
		-Enemy types can be one of the following:
			-GUARD
			-BLOB
			-KNIGHT_D (knight facing down)
			-KNIGHT_U (knight facing up)
			-ROUGE
		-Bosses
			-WHITE_GHOST
			-HATCHET
			-BOAR
			-WOLF
			-MAID
