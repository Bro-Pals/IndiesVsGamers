-----------Actual world tags:-------------
	
	SCENE <int x> <int y>
		-indicate that you're starting to define a scene. When there is already a scene being
			defined and you put down another SCENE tag, then the laste scene will be 
			done being defined

	BLOCK <int x> <int y> <int width> <int height> 
			[<I> <String ImageKey> | <A> <String ImageKey> <int spriteWidth> <int spriteHeight> <long delay>]
		-Creates a new BLOCK in the world with an image. The first two parameters give the scene the
			block will show up in. The next two is the x and y position and the width and height
			 of the block when one is on the screen. Finally, either an Image or an animation is defined.
